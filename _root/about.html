        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a software developer from Accra, Ghana living in Sendai, Japan. I have a strong passion for mobile development, web development and open technologies. I have been in this industry for close to 7 years now which has gained me so much experience. I have a proven track record of successful projects. I am capable of working independently and I do this well with a distributed team.</p>
        <p>I am currently a senior software developer at <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> a non-profit technology company that focuses on building tools for data collection, visualization and interactive mapping. </p>
        <p>I have interest in meeting people and I love to connect people with the right resources and the support they need. I'm always ready to make an introduction.</p>

                <p>I am a <span class="text-danger">geek</span> and a <span class="text-danger">husband</span>. I have practised the art of juggling between being a geek and a husband.</p>

                <p>This year, My wife and I moved from Ghana to live in a bike-friendly city of Sendai, Japan. I cycle to work most of the time and I mostly communute through the city by bicycle. I only use the mass transit when it's necessary.</p>

            <h3><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-plane glyphicon-white"></i> Travel</h3>
        I love to travel. I have gotten the opportunity to travel well enough than most people have. I have travelled for both work and personal reasons.
