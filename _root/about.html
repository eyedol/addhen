        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a software developer from Accra, Ghana currently living in Sendai, Japan. I have a strong passion for mobile development, web development and open technologies. I have been in this industry for close to 7 years now and I have gained so much experience. I have a proven track record of successful projects. I am capable of working independently and I do this well with a distributed team.</p>
        <p>I am currently a senior software developer at <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a>, a non-profit technology company that focuses on building tools for data collection, visualization and interactive mapping. </p>
        <p>I have an interest in meeting people and I love to connect people with the right resources and the support they need.</p>

        I love to travel. I have been afforded the opportunity to do quite a bit of traveling for both work and personal reasons. This has enabled me to learn so much about the world.
